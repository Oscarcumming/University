	 *               1. The user should be given a random question from the question
	 *               Array (see below)
	 * 
	 *               2. User responds
	 * 
	 *               3. User answer should be checked against the answer in the
	 *               answer Array (see below)
	 * 
	 *               4. User is notified of outcome
